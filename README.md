# SimpleVirtualAssistant
A simple virtual asistant coded in Python. I just wanted to know how it works.

This virtual asistant can:

-Tell you good morning/afternoon/night according to time.

-Search something on Wikipedia, and tell you the results.

-Open Youtube or Google just by saying "open google/youtube".

-Tell you the time.
